# trouble
Troubleshooting of, grievances about, or challenges to, software and/or developers

I created this repository to have a place to express 'trouble' as the repo is named, that I wish to be available to the public in case any aspect of software is not behaving or otherwise meeting a standard that really should.

Sometimes I nicely complain to developers but the problem is not fixed or I'm told the more I complain the further down the priority list my grievance goes.

In cases where I rely on certain software or need certain standards or features but do not receive satisfactory support or commitment to standards, I will references posts here for grievances and requests for critical fixes or improvements that aren't getting done.
